# :point_right: Mechanical Engineer does head jump into Software

## Hello folks! ðŸ‘‹
My name is Joana and I am a Mechanical Engineer who took the crazy decision of diving into Software.
Crazy but not going back :muscle:

## What am I currently up to...
- :oncoming_automobile: Learning about Autonomous Driving. 
[Checkout my notes and exercises here](https://github.com/JoanaMota/SelfDrivingCars)
- :computer: Always practicing and increasing my knowledge in C++. [Checkout my implementation and notes on Advanced C++ Courses](https://github.com/JoanaMota/LearnCPP)
- :orange_book: Learning about Design Patterns [Checkout my implementations from the book Head First Design Patterns: A Brain-Friendly Guide](https://github.com/JoanaMota/DesignPatterns)
- Develop my TDD mindset [Chekout my small project using CMake and GTest](https://github.com/JoanaMota/TDD_GTest)

:cloud: I also enjoy learning about Web Development and when I learned about the services provided by `AWS` I started learning about Serverless Applications.
I have been creating some applications for topics that I am interested at the moment and learn the theory at the same time.

- App to track all your car maintenance
